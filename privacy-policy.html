  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 December 2025</p>

  <p>
    CEYE DIGICROP ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to
    protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This policy explains how our
    mobile application ("App") handles user data.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>Camera Access</h3>
  <p>
    Our App requests access to your device’s camera to allow users to capture
    images required for app functionality, such as image-based analysis and
    related features.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Captured images are used only for user-initiated actions.</li>
    <li>We do not access the camera without your explicit permission.</li>
    <li>Images are not shared with third parties without user consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Location Access</h3>
  <p>
    Our App may request access to your device’s location to provide
    location-based functionality, such as contextual insights or region-specific
    analysis.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Location data is collected only when required for app features.</li>
    <li>We do not track your location continuously.</li>
    <li>Location data is not sold or shared with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    The information collected through camera and location permissions is used
    solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core app functionality</li>
    <li>Improve user experience</li>
    <li>Enable features explicitly requested by the user</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect user data from unauthorized access,
    alteration, or disclosure. Any data processed is handled securely and only
    for the duration necessary to fulfill its intended purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties. Data is
    shared only if required by law or with your explicit consent.
  </p>

  <h2>User Control</h2>
  <p>
    You can control or revoke camera and location permissions at any time through
    your device settings. Denying permissions may limit certain app features.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
    collect personal data from children.
  </p>
